There are 3 waits in Selenium / synchronization
->Explicit wait
. Implicit Wait
. Explicit Wait
. Fluent wait - This is similar to explicit wait
All these waits are dynamic waits. It will not put unnecessary wait
-> What is the difference between implicit and explicit wait ?
Implicis : global wait. It will apply the driver whenever driver is used.
Explicit : Local wait. It applies only for specific element. This ise used under an expected condition. We must create a WebDriverWait object to ouse explicit wait.
-> Similarity between imlicit and explicit wait  ?
All these waits are dynamic waits. It will not put unnecessary wait. Both are selenium waits
-> Fluent Wait :
Similar to explicit wait. We can give polling time. We can ignore the exceptions with fluent wait
Wait wait = new FluentWait(WebDriver reference)
withTimeout(5, SECOND) -->>Wait for 5 seconds for the element
pollingEvery(1. SECOND) -->> Check for the element every 1 second
ignoring(Exception.class) -->> We can add ignore exception with fluent wait
-> TestBase : This is used for pre and post conditions. We have Before and After method. We use TestBase by extending it.
